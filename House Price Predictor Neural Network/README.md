# House Price Predictor Neural Network
This directory contains two files, the csv file that contains the data for the house prices and the interactive python notebook that contains the model. The notebook has been pretrained, and to run it go to the bottom cell and enter in the desired inputs. 
*Note: the model is only trained on US house price data, therefore the output will be in US dollars and be based on the US house market.*
